# Drugle
Like Wordle, but for pharmacy!
Guess the drug of the day using the name (brand or generic), and receive hints from the class, indication, and dosage form.
You get 8 guesses.
Begin typing in the box and an autosuggest will present options.
A green box (and bold text) means that box is an exact match to the answer.
A yellow box indicates that a partial match is made, and whatever portion of your guess that is correct will be bolded.
If only one option is in the yellow box and bolded, then there are other options that exist in addition to the one shown.
